## THE BIOLOGY

### Comb Jellies 
All jellyfish are considered jellies, but not all jellies are jellyfish. What gives? It turns out that having a body made of gelatinous material doesn't necessarily mean you’re a jellyfish. For example, the animals known as comb jellies look in many ways like true jellyfish, even though they are actually distant cousins!

Comb jellies are named for their unique feature: plates of giant fused cilia, known as combs, which run in eight rows up and down their bodies. The combs act like tiny oars, propelling the comb jelly through the water while producing a rainbow-like iridescence. While there is much diversity among comb jellies, a common feature they share is multiple long, thin tentacles protruding from the sides of the body, which they wield like fishing lines to capture zooplankton and other tiny crustaceans for food. When the comb jelly is hunting, its tentacles are stretched out and away from its body, allowing it to capture prey upto 20cm away from itself [2].

The hair like cilia give comb jellies the ability to detect and cause very slight disturbances in the water as well. They use the cilia to generate a light current around them, which circulates ocean water very slowly towards them. The slow acceleration of the water transports small, unsuspecting organisms towards their tentacles, which allows them to passively hunt for prey without alerting them to their presence [4]. 

The comb jelly’s tentacles are lined with colloblasts, which are specialized cells that are covered with granules containing a mucus-like adhesive. When their prey touches a tentacle, the granules burst, releasing the adhesive that binds the prey to the tentacle. This immobilizes the organism, and allows the comb jelly to pull it towards its mouth with little resistance [1]. Although they lack a central nervous system, they have a nerve net that directs muscles to aid in swimming, as well as chemoreceptors near the mouth to allow it to “taste” prey. [5]
