## THE BIOLOGY

### Comb Jellies 

When it comes to jellies and jellyfish, sometimes we feel their presence before we actually see them. While this may be a bit unnerving to humans, these fascinating creatures come in such a large variety with unique and complex structures/mechanisms that they’ve become sources of inspiration for scientists and researchers who seek to improve existing technologies. 

All jellyfish are considered jellies, but not all jellies are jellyfish. What gives? It turns out that having a body made of jelly doesn't necessarily mean you are a jellyfish. For example, the animals known as comb jellies look in many ways like true jellyfish, but are actually distant cousins. Comb jellies are named for their unique feature: plates of giant fused cilia, known as combs, which run in eight rows up and down their bodies. The combs act like tiny oars, propelling the comb jelly through the water. Many microscopic organisms, such as bacteria, also use cilia to swim—but comb jellies are the largest known animals to do so. While there is much diversity among comb jellies, a common feature among them is the two long, thin tentacles protruding from the sides of the body, to effectively capture flowing food particles and prey. When the comb jelly is hunting, its tentacles are stretched out and away from its body, allowing it to capture prey upto 20cm away from itself [2]. Although some species of comb jelly swim to search for prey, most employ the “sit and wait” strategy, which is a passive-form of prey capture that involves staying still and waiting for prey to approach their tentacles [2]. These tentacles are lined with colloblasts, which are specialized cells that, upon contact with other organisms, act as a glue to adhere the food to the tentacle and allow the comb jelly to pull it towards its mouth with little resistance [1]. The colloblasts are covered in granules that burst and release the adhesive as soon as they are touched. 

### Karp Lab

Comb jellies and their colloblast-lined tentacles became the muse for The Karp Labs’ researchers, as they sought to engineer a device that could detect cancer cells in the bloodstream. Current methods for cancer cell detection involve running a sample of blood through a channel coated with antibodies, whose purpose is to latch on to specific proteins in the cancer cell’s surface. However, these devices have a hard time doing so because the antibodies are just a few nanometers in length, which is usually too short to easily catch cells in flowing liquid. 

Using the comb jelly’s tentacles as inspiration, Karp Lab designed a device with long chains of DNA made out of aptamers, or repeating, ‘sticky’ blocks of DNA, that could specifically latch on to the protein tyrosine kinase 7, which is found in certain leukemia cells as well as in lung and colon cancers. They also cut the flow surface into a herringbone pattern, causing the flowing blood to swirl around rather than go straight through, making any cancer cells more likely to get snared by the DNA tentacles.
