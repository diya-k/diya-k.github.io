# CIRCULATING TUMOR CELLS
---
## Background into Karp Lab's creation...
Comb jellies and their colloblast-lined tentacles became the muse for The Karp Labs’ researchers, as they sought to engineer a device that could detect circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the bloodstream. to isolate these cells, other researchers have tried building microfluidic devices covered with antibodies specific to a protein found on the cancer cell, and then flowing the blood sample through the device linearly. However, these devices generally low success rates at finding CTCs because the antibodies are just a few nanometers in length, which is usually too short to easily catch cells in flowing liquid.

>- CTCs are cancer cells that escape from the site of the tumor and enter the bloodstream. They pose a great danger to the individual, because they can then spread to vital organs such as the liver, lungs, and brain. 
  - Finding and capturing CTCs are very difficult challenges, because the cells are extremely rare in the patient’s bloodstream, compared to the huge quantities of blood cells. To put the difficulty into perspective: there is approximately one CTC for every billion blood cells in a cancer patient! 
>- Capturing and identifying CTCs from the bloodstream are also beneficial in cancer research and treatment, because they are noninvasive methods of cancer cell detection and collection that can still provide in-depth research about the cancer to scientists.
