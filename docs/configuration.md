Comb jellies and their colloblast-lined tentacles became the muse for The Karp Labs’ researchers, as they sought to engineer a device that could detect cancer cells in the bloodstream. Current methods for cancer cell detection involve running a sample of blood through a channel coated with antibodies, whose purpose is to latch on to specific proteins in the cancer cell’s surface. However, these devices have a hard time doing so because the antibodies are just a few nanometers in length, which is usually too short to easily catch cells in flowing liquid. 
Using the comb jelly’s tentacles as inspiration, Karp Lab designed a device with long chains of DNA made out of aptamers, or repeating, ‘sticky’ blocks of DNA, that could specifically latch on to the protein tyrosine kinase 7, which is found in certain leukemia cells as well as in lung and colon cancers. They also cut the flow surface into a herringbone pattern, causing the flowing blood to swirl around rather than go straight through, making any cancer cells more likely to get snared by the DNA tentacles.
