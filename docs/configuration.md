# BIOINSPIRED DESIGN
---
Comb jellies and their colloblast-lined tentacles became the muse for The Karp Labs’ researchers, as they sought to engineer a device that could detect circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the bloodstream. to isolate these cells, other researchers have tried building microfluidic devices covered with antibodies specific to a protein found on the cancer cell, and then flowing the blood sample through the device linearly. However, these devices generally low success rates at finding CTCs because the antibodies are just a few nanometers in length, which is usually too short to easily catch cells in flowing liquid.

>- CTCs are cancer cells that escape from the site of the tumor and enter the bloodstream. They pose a great danger to the individual, because they can then spread to vital organs such as the liver, lungs, and brain. 
  - Finding and capturing CTCs are very difficult challenges, because the cells are extremely rare in the patient’s bloodstream, compared to the huge quantities of blood cells. To put the difficulty into perspective: there is approximately one CTC for every billion blood cells in a cancer patient! 
>- Capturing and identifying CTCs from the bloodstream are also beneficial in cancer research and treatment, because they are noninvasive methods of cancer cell detection and collection that can still provide in-depth research about the cancer to scientists.

Using the comb jelly’s tentacles as inspiration, Karp Lab designed a device with long chains of DNA molecules containing aptamers, or repeating, ‘sticky’ blocks of DNA, that could specifically latch and bind onto Tyrosine Kinase 7, which is a protein found in certain leukemia cells. Because these aptamers were long and designed to stick out into the blood, they were much more successful at contacting cancer cells, compared to the antibodies used in other devices. Aptamers are extremely versatile, and they bind onto their targets very selectively; they are also chemically synthesized, which means that they can be specifically tuned to latch onto unique targets. because antibodies can only be produced during an immune response in live organisms, it’s much more difficult to tune them to be able to bind onto specific proteins. ![](https://github.com/diya-k/diya-k.github.io/blob/master/captured_cells.PNG)

They also cut the surface of the device into a herringbone pattern, which forced blood flowing through the device to swirl around, rather than move straight through. Just as the aptamers mimicked the comb jelly’s sticky tentacles, this new flow pattern mimicked the unpredictable, circulating nature of ocean currents. As a result, the combination of robust, long aptamers with the swirling blood flow strategy made Karp Lab’s device very effective at capturing CTCs, with a reported 60-80% capture rate.
