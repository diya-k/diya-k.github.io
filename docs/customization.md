# Karp Lab's Bioinpsired Microfluidic Device 
{: .no_toc }

Using the comb jelly’s tentacles as inspiration, researchers at Karp Lab designed a device with long chains of DNA molecules containing aptamers, or repeating, ‘sticky’ blocks of DNA, that could specifically latch and bind onto Tyrosine Kinase 7, which is a protein found in certain leukemia cells. Because these aptamers were long and designed to stick out into the blood, they were much more successful at contacting cancer cells, compared to the antibodies used in other devices. Aptamers are extremely versatile, and they bind onto their targets very selectively; they are also chemically synthesized, which means that they can be specifically tuned to latch onto unique targets. 
-	This makes the process of producing aptamers much more sustainable, as it eliminates the need for animal testing in this area of research and reduces the environmental and economic costs of working with living organisms.

The researchers also cut the surface of the device into a herringbone pattern, which forced blood flowing through the device to swirl around, rather than move straight through. Just as the aptamers mimicked the comb jelly’s sticky tentacles, this new flow pattern mimicked the unpredictable, circulating nature of ocean currents. As a result, the combination of robust, long aptamers with the swirling blood flow strategy made Karp Lab’s device very effective at capturing CTCs, with a reported 60-80% capture rate.
